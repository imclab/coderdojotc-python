Here is a list of the files with a short description of what each script does and 
what programming concepts are introduced:


File                                | Description
----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------
Minecraft_Programming_Reference.pdf | (Documentation)  Summary of Minecraft API and Python syntax
clear.py                            | (Utility script)  Lets you specify an area to clear out in your Minecraft world to make building easier
coderdojo.py                        | Hello World!  Writes "CoderDojo" in block letters in the game. We started with this to have them experience modifying the game in a neat way and then we have them open it in IDLE and change the string to their name or whatever they want.
minecraft_letters.py                | (Utility script) The code that constructs the letters for `coderdojo.py`.
flying.py                           | Check whether the character is flying.  Introduce variables, coordinates and `if`/`else`.
tower.py                            | Build a simple tower.  Introduce `while` loop and the `SetBlock` method.
tower2.py                           | Build a simple tower just like `tower.py`.  Introduce `for` loop as alternative to `while`.
pyramid.py                          | Build a pyramid.  Demonstrate a more complicated `while` loop and the `SetBlocks` method.
